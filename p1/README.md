## Game Planning
+ Create an array with five elements: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock
+ For Player A, assign a random move
+ For Player B, assign a random move
+ Compare Player A move vs Player B Move
+ Select a winnner or declare a tie
+ Report the results - What Player A threw, What Player B threw, Who is declared the winner

## Outside Sources
+ Game Idea: [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors,_Lizard,_Spock)
+ Research on how to iterate through an array of arrays: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10131802/foreach-for-arrays-inside-of-an-array)

## Notes for Instructor
+ I was in between Medium and Advanced, but wasn't sure I was ready for building a war game yet, so I went with a slightly more complex rock paper scissors game. Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock!
